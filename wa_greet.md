Hello fellow opensourcer!

Welcome to Hackoctoberfest Guwahati WhatsApp Group!

Legend:
- ❗ : Important
- 🐖 : Optional

Here are the things you'd want to do just after you join the group:

1. ❗️ Read the rules(below) for this WhatsApp group.
2. 🐖 Introduce yourself in one single message.
3. [Register for Hackoctoberfest](https://github.com/buildandtell/hackoctoberfestghy19#steps-to-signup-for-hackoctoberfest) if you have not already!
4. Ask your questions away! 😃
5. ❗️ Read this article on [how to ask good questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/) by [Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk)

Rules:

1. You should not DM someone from the group with a question that could benifit other participants, this will be selfish on your side and will be a repeat if someone else asks the same question later. Rather, ask the question publicly in the group. Sharing is caring 👼
2. Participants violating the [CoC](https://do.co/hacktoberconduct) will be sanctioned or expelled from the event and the WhatsApp group at the discretion of the event organizers.
