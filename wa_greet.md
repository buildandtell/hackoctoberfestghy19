Hello, fellow opensourcer!

Welcome to Hackoctoberfest Guwahati WhatsApp Group! Here are a few things you'd want to do just after joining the group:

1. Introduce yourself in one single message. (optional)
2. [Register for Hackoctoberfest](https://github.com/buildandtell/hackoctoberfestghy19#steps-to-signup-for-hackoctoberfest) if you have not already!
3. Ask your questions away! ðŸ˜ƒ
4. Read this article on [how to ask good questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/) by [Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk)
5. Read the rules below.

### Rules:

1. You should not DM someone from the group with a question that could benefit other participants, this will be selfish on your side and will be a repeat if someone else asks the same question later. Rather, ask the question publicly in the group. Sharing is caring ðŸ‘¼
2. Participants violating the [CoC](https://do.co/hacktoberconduct) will be sanctioned or expelled from the event and the WhatsApp group at the discretion of the event organizers.
