Hello and welcome! 🎉

The goal for this group is to give you the help you need to get started in contributing to open source. 

We'll have a daylong meetup consisting of interesting talks and workshops on a weekend after the 10th of October'19 and another one towards the end of October.

Will share more information on offline events very soon.
- [03/10/19, 12:59:10 PM] Hrishikesh: 🧶(2/4)

Through the lifetime of this group *(Oct 2nd - Nov 2nd)* we’ll work from the small —creating your GitHub account, then understanding what open source is. Then step out and invite some interesting people to do AMAs here in the group, learn some best practices and importance of communication in OSS, share learning resources, etc.

There is no specific time we meet here in the group, you should be able to get help at any time of the day.

Once you complete the challenge, do let us know :)
- [03/10/19, 1:00:04 PM] Hrishikesh: 🧶(3/4)

What kinds of questions you can ask, you ask?

💡If it's a code related help, but try googling first.
💡If it's a question related to git/GitHub any other tool involved.
💡If you're not able to find a repository to contribute to.
💡If you need learning material on something.
💡If it's about the opensource ecosystem.

If you think any other question is appropriate for the group, please do ask.

We'll keep a daily chat log at: http://bit.ly/hof-ghy-chat so that new participants can view previous messages.
- [03/10/19, 1:00:12 PM] ‪NUMBERNUMBER‬: 👍🏽
- [03/10/19, 1:00:55 PM] Hrishikesh: 🧶(4/4)

Everyone in the group can help everyone, but we also have members who are maintainers of OSS projects, GSoC mentors and people who have been contributing to OSS for a significant amount of time, so you're well backed. 👨‍👨‍👦‍👦👩‍👩‍👧‍👧

I'd encourage members to introduce themselves.

One more thing,

This isn’t a WhatsApp University :D, it’s a conversation. If you don’t understand something, have any question, please ask.
- [03/10/19, 1:03:48 PM] Hrishikesh: So all the best! 👊👊

this is a good first step👆 read through the *intro to open source* by digital ocean. it's a good intro.

(this page is best viewed on larger screens)
- [03/10/19, 2:02:38 PM] ‪NUMBERNUMBER‬: Have a rough idea on how github and open source works. Would be preparing for the upcoming GSOC next year. Would continue tuning Mozilla and its UI for now.

- [03/10/19, 4:17:04 PM] Saurav Twittee: also, check out the page! https://hackoctoberfest-ghy.netlify.com/
You must have a GitHub account and then registered for it.
- [03/10/19, 4:23:18 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Thanks. Checking out
- [03/10/19, 4:23:49 PM] Joinal WA: @NUMBERNUMBER can we do a bot of some kind, auto greet with pointers to relevant links
- [03/10/19, 4:26:45 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: registered in github and hacktober.Now what next?
- [03/10/19, 4:27:23 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/


Can we all contribute to this one?
- [03/10/19, 4:30:52 PM] Hrishikesh: does it have a github repository? for participating, the project you're going to contribute to has to be hosted on GitHub.
- [03/10/19, 4:31:57 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Oh okay, I need to check that.
- [03/10/19, 4:33:16 PM] Hrishikesh: you need to find a repository/project to contribute to.  see the section Hacktoberfest projects at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/

you can filter projects based on languages you know there.
- [03/10/19, 4:34:52 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: We can choose any project on github, right?
- [03/10/19, 4:35:05 PM] Hrishikesh: that's true.
- [03/10/19, 4:35:15 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: 👍🏻
- [03/10/19, 4:48:09 PM] Hrishikesh: think this will be an overkill for now, I've added the intro message from the morning to the *Read this first* link in the group description.
- [03/10/19, 4:48:22 PM] Joinal WA: Okay
- [03/10/19, 4:48:50 PM] Joinal WA: But, can be a great task for contributions
- [03/10/19, 4:52:40 PM] Hrishikesh: haha, damn right. Contributing to your own repositories still count as contributions towards the 4PRs for Hackoctoberfest.

as long as you don't abuse this, 10/10 someone can take this project up. 😁
- [03/10/19, 4:53:09 PM] Joinal WA: Yes
- [03/10/19, 4:53:16 PM] Joinal WA: And we can use this later also
- [03/10/19, 4:53:28 PM] Joinal WA: Or maybe opensource it for future
- [03/10/19, 4:54:19 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Ah, I've my own repo, I can work on that then
- [03/10/19, 4:54:43 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: @NUMBERNUMBER, remember? Last year you too contributed to that!
- [03/10/19, 4:58:25 PM] Hrishikesh: the only drawback i see to this is that, you will not get feedbacks and you'll just be confined to your own project. 

Contributing to someone else's code, 
1. you'll learn to read other ppl's code
2. you'll have to communicate with them
3. you meet new people.
4. most of the time when you contribute to some well written repository, you end up writing better code.

I think there are many more benifits to contributing to someone else's project.
- [03/10/19, 4:58:38 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: My humble suggestion is to understand how many of the group members know how to use github
- [03/10/19, 4:59:30 PM] Joinal WA: Agreed
- [03/10/19, 4:59:31 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: I barely know!
- [03/10/19, 5:00:46 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: I can rate my github using skills for like 7 from a scale of 0 to 10
- [03/10/19, 5:01:58 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: For those who are new to GitHub, someone needs to help them out
- [03/10/19, 5:02:04 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Mine is barely 1. I can just code & upload!
- [03/10/19, 5:02:55 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: I think this should be the first step if we want our mission to succeed in the long run

- [03/10/19, 5:04:54 PM] Hrishikesh: @NUMBERNUMBER has a video up on YouTube where he explains Git and GitHub in Assamese. 

I am sure it'll help. 
https://youtu.be/v3SIwwPjUGU

We'll try to add a beginner section to the website as well. soon.
- [03/10/19, 5:05:26 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Sure, thanks for sharing the video
- [03/10/19, 5:06:08 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Can we also plan for some knowledge sharing session on GitHub for the beginners
- [03/10/19, 5:06:22 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Lot of youtube tutorials available for the same
- [03/10/19, 5:06:25 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: I can we can make them use some youtube references to learn everything about Github and Git as a whole
- [03/10/19, 5:06:45 PM] ‎‪NUMBER:‬ joined using this group's invite link
- [03/10/19, 5:07:18 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Videos are there but actual hands on session will be better
- [03/10/19, 5:08:30 PM] Hrishikesh: We're planning for an offline meetup after 10th October. date and venue is not fixed yet. will keep the group updated about it.
- [03/10/19, 5:09:00 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Ok sure, thanks for the initiative

- [03/10/19, 5:10:30 PM] Joinal WA: @NUMBERNUMBER connect with Girlscript Guwahati lead
- [03/10/19, 5:11:55 PM] Hrishikesh: messaged on LinkedIn, waiting for response.
- [03/10/19, 5:12:09 PM] Joinal WA: Shall i ask Anubha about this?
- [03/10/19, 5:12:20 PM] Amartya Sk: Eshita Nandy ?
- [03/10/19, 5:12:31 PM] Joinal WA: FYI Anubha is Girlscript founder?
- [03/10/19, 5:12:35 PM] Joinal WA: I guess so
- [03/10/19, 5:33:51 PM] Saurav Twittee: That will be awesome
- [03/10/19, 5:36:13 PM] Saurav Twittee: Connect with the local coding clubs,chapters and if there any gdg ah we don't have an active gdg yet from northeast!!
- [03/10/19, 5:47:14 PM] Mriyam da: For the people asking Git and/or GitHub, I've found these videos to be helpful in the past(only for those who don't prefer text, but text is almost always better than video),

Also, the link shared by @NUMBERNUMBER from Julia's blog - https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/ is a must read for people getting into open source.
If you do read this, I'd also suggest this as additional reading - http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
- [03/10/19, 5:51:10 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Gdg chapter is required
- [03/10/19, 6:06:08 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Thanks
- [03/10/19, 7:06:46 PM] Saurav Twittee: Hi 

You can simply contribute to documentation part for a project too other than coding!


Just keep on looking for a good issue that you are interested to work on,make sure you leave a comment there in that issue that you wanna work on so that the maintainer can assign you for that then simply fork it,make changes as mentioned in the issue and make Pull Request!
- [03/10/19, 7:31:37 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: what else we can work on apart from coding?
- [03/10/19, 8:09:05 PM] Mriyam da: Open source projects require a lot of help apart from coding. 

You can help -

* Write documentation
* Triage issues
and many others.
- [03/10/19, 8:11:15 PM] Mriyam da: But whatever information we're giving is likely less compared to the curated resources explaining every question being asked by beginners which can be found here in the link @NUMBERNUMBER mentioned. 


https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details


Check the beginners section
- [03/10/19, 8:15:00 PM] Mriyam da: For example, I checked out https://www.firsttimersonly.com/, which I got from the above link.

There is a really cool video mentioned - http://www.getinvolvedintech.com/

Also found a link to a site which displays any GitHub user's first PR, and as an example here is Kent's first PR https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/616

It's just a spelling mistake fix, which is perfect for a first time PR. It shows that one understands Git and knows how to create a pull request on GitHub.
- [03/10/19, 8:30:15 PM] Hrishikesh: the video mentioned by @NUMBERNUMBER  is from Scott Hanselman's page. Very friendly person to follow on Twitter, he tweets about oss as well.

Tells you the meta information that is required when contributing like, _Look through the existing issues and PRs_ and other helpful tips.
- [05/10/19, 9:43:48 AM] Anubhav: Can we make it into a sticky or pinned message?
- [05/10/19, 10:08:07 AM] Guyaec: it's in description, and the rest remaining links can be put there. but not as sticky banner like telegram WhatsApp doesn't have that I think.
- [05/10/19, 11:42:04 PM] Hrishikesh: Hello, hope everyone is doing good!

By now, most of us already know that a GitHub repository can contain anything and not only code.

So, @NUMBERNUMBER is preparing a GitHub repository which will be a list of all members from this group with their github handle and other social media links. 🌎

members of this group can make a PR with their name, github handle and social links. 

this will help know each other better as well as will be a good first PR. :)

There will also be supporting instructions on how to go about adding your name and links to the list with a PR.

Thanks to @NUMBERNUMBER for the idea.
- [05/10/19, 11:44:34 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Wow. Awesome 👌

- [08/10/19, 11:43:50 AM] Mriyam da: Looks like a few people did send PRs. 🥳 

Those who're completely new to Git/GitHub you can read the links provided and also watch the demo video given in the repository's README. 🏃‍♀🏃‍♂
- [08/10/19, 11:45:30 AM] Mriyam da: Those who created the PR in this repository or already know the Git/GitHub PR can find an open source repository they like and contribute to it.

Once you create 4 PRs this month, and get them merged, you'll get a cool T-Shirt and some stickers!🔥🎉
- [08/10/19, 11:48:41 AM] Mriyam da: If you don't know which project/repositories you should contribute to, you can find some suggestions on the main site itself - https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/

But this is not an exhaustive list, you can contribute to any project/repositories on GitHub, whether they are marked for Hacktoberfest or not.
- [08/10/19, 11:52:53 AM] Mriyam da: If anyone *has gone through the already shared resources* and are still facing problems, you can message me directly with your question. Happy to help.

- [08/10/19, 2:26:57 PM] Joinal WA: @NUMBERNUMBER @NUMBERNUMBER @NUMBERNUMBER as per HacktoberFest guidelines, only high quality contributions qualify for a PR to recieve goodies from DO
- [08/10/19, 2:27:05 PM] Joinal WA: Please comply
- [08/10/19, 2:28:45 PM] Joinal WA: And discourage folks to apply for goodies with only basic PRs
- [08/10/19, 2:30:22 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: What does basic PRs mean?
- [08/10/19, 2:31:15 PM] Mriyam da: Just chiming in, from the Hacktoberfest site

_To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and then make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as invalid or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt. (Last year 46,088 earned a shirt!)_
- [08/10/19, 2:31:47 PM] Joinal WA: Consider the PR you'd be submitting in the Repo LearnPR, this just helps you learn git basics and doesn't has any significant code contributions
- [08/10/19, 2:33:16 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: Thanks for the reply
- [08/10/19, 2:34:18 PM] Joinal WA: Hi there,
Thanks for your interest in Hacktoberfest and helping others learn how to make their first contributions to open source!
That said, high-quality contributions are part of the the core values of Hacktoberfest, so we kindly ask that you do not create repositories which allow users to quickly gain a PR toward completing the challenge.
We encourage you to take a look at our list of Hacktoberfest issues for inspiration and ideas about making meaningful contributions to open source projects.
Due to this, we've added this repository to our list of excluded repositories and pull requests here will not count toward Hacktoberfest 2019.
Please note, you are welcome to keep running this repository as a learning tool for new contributors to open-source, but pull requests won’t count toward Hacktoberfest.
Happy Hacking,
The Hacktoberfest Team
Hacktoberfest is presented by DigitalOcean and DEV.
- [08/10/19, 2:35:04 PM] Joinal WA: From the team that handles HacktoberFest at DO
- [08/10/19, 2:35:15 PM] Joinal WA: Not an issue
- [08/10/19, 2:45:43 PM] Mriyam da: Agree with this. LearnPR repo should not be part of the PRs one considers as their contribution to Hacktoberfest.
- [08/10/19, 2:45:58 PM] Joinal WA: Exactly
- [08/10/19, 2:46:37 PM] Joinal WA: https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#quality-standards
- [08/10/19, 2:47:58 PM] Joinal WA: I'll release a few "good for first contributions" into one of my projects tomorrow
- [08/10/19, 2:48:05 PM] Hrishikesh: part of this message talking about contributions going towards hacktoberfest is cancelled then.

anyway still is a good way to get started.
- [08/10/19, 2:48:42 PM] Joinal WA: Not saying it's noy a good way to get started
- [08/10/19, 2:49:13 PM] Joinal WA: But, shouldn't be considered as a PR to be counted as one of 5
- [08/10/19, 2:50:02 PM] Joinal WA: We as org admins, project mantainers will ensure to release atleast 5 issues for the participants to work on and contribute

I've been searching for hours, watched quite a few videos, but can't understand what exactly this is! Coming from Mechanichal Engineering background, my idea of Entropy is that from Thermal background!

- [12/10/19, 3:41:45 PM] Hrishikesh: *Reminder*

We'll be having an ama with Ashris at 9PM today.
- [12/10/19, 4:36:26 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: 🤘
- [12/10/19, 9:08:24 PM] ‎You added Ashrish Choudhary
- [12/10/19, 9:09:06 PM] Hrishikesh: Hello everyone,

We have the first AMA in the month of October today. 🥳

Thanks Ashrish for joining us here! I've already introduced him but I'd still like to ask Asrish to introduce himself briefly to the group whenever he's ready.

**Note:**
He'll be doing this ama till 10PM, so ask away your questions and he'll try his best to answer them. :)
- [12/10/19, 9:09:54 PM] Hrishikesh: *Ashris : typo
- ‎[12/10/19, 9:10:56 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: ‎video omitted
- [12/10/19, 9:10:57 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: ^ Hey guys! Looking forward to your questions! Thanks Hrishikesh for organizing this.
- [12/10/19, 9:12:44 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: Hii Ashris Bhaiya thanks for AMA
- [12/10/19, 9:13:07 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: my question is that How do you choose project? How you select the difficulty of the project?
- [12/10/19, 9:15:54 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: So I have done the Hacktoberfest twice. The best way I think is to look for the Hacktoberfest tag on Github - lot of people tag beginner friendly bugs for you to solve, that could be a good start. You can even work with some college seniors on their projects - usually someone who has worked in Hacktoberfest before is a good idea. Look for something that is in your comfort zone, is beginner friendly and can be done using 10-15 lines of code. Discussing with the repo owner about the complexity of the bug you are trying to fix can be a good start. Wish you all the best!
- [12/10/19, 9:16:42 PM] Amartya Sk: Hello  Ashris, Thank You for your time. Media Labs must be awesome experience.

I'd like to ask , what are your views on startup teams , Suppose you have a startup and, you're taking in more members ,  like  what qualities do you look in a person who'd want to join your team.
- [12/10/19, 9:16:43 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: ok thanks🙂
- [12/10/19, 9:16:53 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq#general <- is a good starting point.
- [12/10/19, 9:17:40 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: Hi! How to get into PhD in MIT. I'm 34 years old and been in academics all my life, no industrial experience
- [12/10/19, 9:21:11 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: This is such a relevant and a great question. When investors look to find ideas, they look at the team also. Not only should your idea be impactful but you should prove why you are the right people to solve it. At MIT, in one of the entrepreneurship classes, I was told that every good startup needs a combination of 3 kinds of people - the hustler, the hacker and the hipster. Hustlers are the ones who know business, can do sales and marketing. Hackers are your tech wizs and Hipsters are the Design/product wizs who know why to build something. When I try to team with someone, I see which domain do they belong to and how much of self driven projects have they done - because that shows that they are genuinely interested and skilled in what they do.
- [12/10/19, 9:24:40 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: So I might not be the best person to answer this because I think of myself more of the startup guy than an academic guy, but I think the key to a good PhD is the right mentor who aligns with your goals and is willing to support you. Writing to professors about your interests and experience would be great. Attending conferences in US where you can network with Professors directly is a good option. MIT also has some great tie ups with Indian companies like TATA where they can sponsor PhD students working on topics crucial for developing nations. Reaching out to these institutions would be great.
- [12/10/19, 9:24:57 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: What would you suggest -mastering one particular domain or jack of all trade?
- [12/10/19, 9:25:46 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: The last line was valuable for me. I didn't know that. Thanks 😊
- [12/10/19, 9:26:03 PM] Amartya Sk: Awesome , got it , Hustler - Hacker - Hipster. 

Also , I'd like to know , what is the stage/state of a startup when it starts getting funded ? Like , (1) the idea state (we can do this that wala state), (2) some tid bid research done wala state , (3) prototype ready wala state (4) some revenue generated wala state.
- [12/10/19, 9:27:03 PM] Hrishikesh: When you were a student, how did you takeout time to start and finish a side projects? It's easy to start something but finishing it is the hard part for me. Or putting this another way, at what point do you think we should stop working on a side project because it's taking too much time. I've only managed to finish only a few but it's just demotivating when I look at the number of dead projects that I have :p
- [12/10/19, 9:28:05 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: plz answer this. I have the same problem
- [12/10/19, 9:28:10 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: ..
- [12/10/19, 9:28:39 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Definitely master one domain in the long run. Find one domain where you are in the top 5% of the world. Now, the interesting thing is 'domain' is not defined well. I believe we are living in a world where domains are merging to become new domains. Like psychology, neurology and AI combine to form cognitive augmentation. The established domains like physics, maths are all saturated, it is extremely hard to shine there. So for the initial years, like now, try to be a jack of all trades - do many things until you find the right mixture, make it a domain and be great at it. For example, I was good in design and code. Was I an awesome coder? Maybe not. Was I an awesome designer? Maybe not. But when I combined them two and did data viz, I unlocked a field not many are doing and it was easy for me to do things. I recommend this route.
- [12/10/19, 9:28:56 PM] Amartya Sk: Also , another question , like what would you prefer , the attitude of a startup leader should be - (1) day /night we have to do this anyhow , some team members have some errand to do ,go later  complete now  wala attitude , or (2) or go , do your errand and we can complete this later wala attitude. ?
- [12/10/19, 9:31:39 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Make a goal towards which you are working. For me, the goal was getting in to MIT Media Lab, I would think about it while sleeping, while dreaming, while walking. It motivated me to do things. I knew that no matter how many ideas I have, it is only the finished ones that will go to my portfolio. At one time, I was just filling the grid boxes with thumbnails of my incomplete projects that would motivate me to finish them. Once I finished one after a lot of hard work, I was addicted to keep going. So build that momentum, align yourself to some external goal towards which you are working. In my initial years, it was just about impressing my friends with my ideas - find an external drive.
- [12/10/19, 9:32:14 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: ok I get it . I was a bit of confusion to how should I invest my time . it's clear now.
- [12/10/19, 9:33:46 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Definitely 4 - someone will pour money on you when you already have set the fire and their money would just help it blaze more and earn more money 💰💰💰. You have to solve a problem of society that society doesn't yet know how to fix. There is no short cut. No prototype or website is going to fake it. You need to find someone willing to pay for your product, only then can you even think of an investor.
- [12/10/19, 9:38:03 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Interesting. As a startup founder, you are someone who is creating a new thing in the world. You are like a mother to a baby. Can a mother leave the baby and just chill? No, the baby is too fragile and it will die of negligence. A startup is like that, you have to nurture it continuously. When you have employees, you cannot babysit them, they need to feel part of the product also to give their 200%. So if you are serious about a startup, it should be everything of your life - something you think when you sleep and when you wake up - this is why startups are not for everyone. It is bleed for 5 years so that you dont have to bleed ever again wala mentality.
- [12/10/19, 9:38:56 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: How to get into MIT media lab like you?
- [12/10/19, 9:40:57 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: Adding to your answer I would like to ask that how to choose which particular field I should master in by keeping in mind about the scenario of the future market?
- [12/10/19, 9:40:57 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Work on crazy projects, have a stellar portfolio, reach out to professors personally and learn new things every day - even if it doesn't guarantee Media Lab, you will easily be ahead of 99% of people your age.
- [12/10/19, 9:41:37 PM] Hrishikesh: haha awesome! thanks a lot! I've started following a very similar approach. I am not sure if it can be called an external drive but I've made a small list of practical ideas to work on, i keep thinking and brainstorming on them a lot and during my final days at college just prepping myself so that i can work on them later on.
- [12/10/19, 9:42:27 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: yahh. trying hard matters.
- [12/10/19, 9:43:03 PM] Amartya Sk: 💯 onpoint.
- [12/10/19, 9:44:58 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Three things - what you love doing, what pays you well and what you are good at. You may love aerospace and it even pays well but if you arent good at it, there is no point. Try to find things that hit all these boxes. Now, what pays you well is a subjective thing, there is no way of being sure but the world is going in a direction, there are some things like AI, creativity, data, service based industries, Electric vehicles and blockchains which are booming - see what connects with you in these emerging fields. Don't stress out too much, as a thumb rule if you can code, you are guaranteed on the pay well aspect - the other two checkboxes are for you to infer.
- [12/10/19, 9:45:17 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Sounds awesome! Pretty similar to what I had done too.
- [12/10/19, 9:46:18 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: Should the projects be something that no one ever tried which is very new.?
- [12/10/19, 9:47:23 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: Thanks✨
- [12/10/19, 9:47:34 PM] Amartya Sk: What does it take to make it to an Ivy league Masters or Maybe CSAIL Masters  , like is it Research Work done  of similar kind to the projects ongoing at CSAIL , or is it something different (like entire portfolio) , how far GRE marks/ institute name holds strong to admission process.
- [12/10/19, 9:48:45 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Yes and no - Media Lab values interdisciplinary approach to building things. You can take two normal but unrelated skills and fuse them together to make something new. You don't have to reinvent the wheel, just find new ways existing things can be paired. Be really good at one thing - electronics, code or fabrication and show how you can use them like artists use colors, poets use poetry to create magic.
- [12/10/19, 9:50:03 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Depends on the uni but yes, your institute, your GPA, your GRE, Letters of recommendation from machau people, SOP and yes, connections - all of these things. Having stellar internships also helps.
- [12/10/19, 9:53:20 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: How much time we should devote to do projects or  learning in one field may be it is data science or block chain? When to move to other field?
- [12/10/19, 9:54:14 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Personally, I think Masters have become very devalued. We live in a world where knowledge is freely flowing. There is no 'knowledge' that is specially stored in these degrees - it is the connections and the stamp of a good university people go to these colleges for. I didn't think the ego boost is worth so much money. But if you have dispensible money and you want to do Masters for exploring new culture, pursue something very special, are evry sure that you want to work in a certain country or you know that the alumnus network is strong for you to go where you want in life, then go ahead. But doing masters from a fancy place just because society thinks its cool is a very very bad and an expensive idea.
- [12/10/19, 9:56:52 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: You cannot learn or even master a field while you are in college. People have been working on these for decades, you surely cant master these in a year. So I'd advise the best investment of your time in college should be to learn how to learn. Realize you will never master a thing fully but you can learn the basics so well that it helps you even when you are doing something unrelated. It is not the same as jack of all trades - it is knowing the basics of many fields very strongly so that you can use them if you have to.
- [12/10/19, 9:57:55 PM] Arunav GIMT: If you are doing your project in data science is it necessary to publish paper in reputed publications???
- [12/10/19, 9:58:52 PM] Hrishikesh: When looking at it generally, how much of a difference do you think college(high ed) makes in a Student's life?

Do you think graduating from a not so good college(or should I say where the education is bad) pre 2015 vs graduating from that same college today in 2019 is different because we have so much of great learning materials on the Internet today that college should not matter at all?
- [12/10/19, 9:59:05 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: ok . After all its important to master the basics of all.
- [12/10/19, 10:00:49 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Ugh, I personally haven't read more than 10 papers in my life. I find them very boring. It isn't the medium that is important but your work. I honestly just write Medium articles, it has helped my work reach to more people. I find the academic paper wala language to be very terse and unnescessarily complex. It is one of the reasons I did not pursue academia ahead. If you are sure that academia is your thing, then yes, writing papers and getting them published is very important, but if you are doing a startup or are applying for jobs, its not important enough. Reading papers will definitely help you sharpen your mind, but not necessarily writing for publications.
- [12/10/19, 10:00:53 PM] Hrishikesh: *Note:* AMA ends in ~5 mins

Sourav here 

What are your views on opensource in AI?
Can you give some inputs and trends about it! 

Also if you share any cool project you have worked on and YouTube channel link!!
- [12/10/19, 10:03:07 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: I love this question. Yes, the world has changed sooooo much! It matters so little where you studied if you are in the startup world, maybe except for impressing few snobby VCs. YouTube, Coursera, all of those have shattered the walls academia had created. There is no reason to cite your college as an excuse. If you are smart, ambitious and hard working,(and are blessed to be born in a stable family in a stable country - which I hope you all are) this is the best time to be alive.
- [12/10/19, 10:03:08 PM] Arunav GIMT: thanks a lot
- [12/10/19, 10:03:48 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: @NUMBERNUMBER I totally don't mind spending more time if people have more questions :)

- [12/10/19, 10:05:47 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: Thanks for all the help
- [12/10/19, 10:07:09 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Hey Sourav! Open Source is responsible for probably 80% of the innovation happening today in the world. OpenAI, the initiative by Elon Musk is sharing so much of quality resources. Side note, all of you should be on Twitter and follow these guys - ElonMusk, Open AI, Andrej Karpathy, etc etc - you will get so much of cutting edge research work right in your feed. You can have a look at my projects at https://iashris.com - I think the Facebook network visualization (it has a video on YouTube) is probably the coolest one, followed by https://13x29.github.io
- [12/10/19, 10:07:57 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Yo guys! I had so much fun doing this, feel free to reach out to me at hello@NUMBERiashris.com

it's been so great having you here today!
- [12/10/19, 10:09:23 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Likewise, I think all of the folks in this group are incredibly fortunate to have their mentor take initiatives like this. Keep learning, keep exploring and keep evolving, yo!
- [12/10/19, 10:09:46 PM] ‪\NUMBERNUMBER:‬: How to get into top IT companies ?  some people say competitive programming help a lot, some says having interesting project helps. What would you say??
- [12/10/19, 10:13:13 PM] Hrishikesh: *Note*: we'll publish a blogpost in a day or two with the questions and answers from this AMA so that people who missed it can read it later. is that fine by you @NUMBERNUMBER?
- [12/10/19, 10:13:42 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Well, each company has its own way of picking people. Once you are being interviewed, it is your acumen that matters there. The tough part is to get an interview after being shortlisted through the series of automated tests. Some hacks help like having the keywords in your resume that companies are looking for. But nothing beats just being plain good in your skills. Some sure shot things that work is to be more visible - go present your work in conferences, take up GSoC, participate in the Facebook bug bountry programs, start helping startups in their open source projects - if you do all this, may be not the top4 [facebook, google, apple, amazon] come to you, but many IT companies will line up for you to join them.
- [12/10/19, 10:14:01 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Of course! Do go ahead.

1. Add xyz algorithm implementation for abc problem 
2. Improve the docs for xyz
3. Fix the bug that's causing xyz

once you create an issue, you'll be able to add a label to it clicking on the sidebar to the right
- [18/10/19, 2:24:51 PM] ‪NUMBER‬: Check this https://help.github.com/en/articles/applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests
- [18/10/19, 2:26:27 PM] Hrishikesh: people can then look at the issue, understand the problem then send prs for the same. 

you can add the label "Hacktoberfest", "good-first-issue", "beginner-friendly" etc if you feel like but it's not necessary.
- [18/10/19, 2:29:35 PM] Hrishikesh: good way to get some drive by contributors. the learnPR repository that we made for this group is getting prs from people who don't even know that this repository is part of Hacktoberfest Guwahati.

They are simply contributing because of the Hacktoberfest label.

- [18/10/19, 10:10:10 PM] Mriyam da: I believe yes. Hacktoberfest is just a means to an end, that is, to increase awareness of open source and encourage/incentivize beginners to contribute.

Regardless of where you are in your open source journey, you can attend. If you're at a beginner level, you might learn something. If you're at an advanced level, maybe you can share some knowledge and help others learn something.

- [19/10/19, 9:20:27 PM] ‪NUMBER‬: This is happening because your codes are still the same(i guess)(that means its still not updated). Check once that the changes that you have made are reflected or not.
- [19/10/19, 9:22:18 PM] ‪NUMBER‬: I haven't made any changes...I want to know..where do I actually make the change(rather add something)

- [19/10/19, 9:25:06 PM] ‪NUMBER‬: Okk

- [19/10/19, 9:29:24 PM] ‪NUMBER‬: Thank you
- [19/10/19, 9:30:01 PM] Kabir: Since, you have already forked and cloned it.

Create a new branch with

- branch <name>

Add the .py files or the content related to the algos you want to add in the appropriate directories.

Then add and commit these using

-git add .
-git commit -m "some msg"

Then push these changes to the branch you just created using 

- git push -u origin <branch_name>

Once thats done, go back to the pull requests section.

Now you can compare the master and the new branch you create

Submit the pull request.

And that should be it
- [19/10/19, 9:30:27 PM] Mriyam da: Steps to ask for help

0. *Explain what you want to do* instead of what you tried and failed to do. (Read: https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/66378)
1. Use the screenshot feature of your laptop, share screenshot directly on Whatsapp(use Whatsapp web on laptop) *OR* use screenshot sharing service - https://prnt.sc/, https://snipboard.io/
2. Apart from screenshot, sharing the code itself helps, using services like https://gist.github.com, http://sprunge.us/, https://paste.debian.net/
3. In case the problem you are having concerns code already on the internet, on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, simply share the link(of the repository, branch of specific line of code).

Following these steps will allow people helping you to understand the issue quicker and *you will get a solution sooner*.
- [19/10/19, 9:30:33 PM] Anubhav: somebody is alive
- [19/10/19, 9:32:49 PM] ‪NUMBER‬: Okk it seems..after creating the branch name I didn't add any files rather jumped to the commands git add.

if one pr among the first pr is rejected then it'll pick one up from the subsequent prs for the 4th one. 

not an issue, about the swags, the site mentions that the first 50k ppl will get it or something similar. so if you're among the first 50k you should get the mail about it by end of oct or after.

- [22/10/19, 8:19:47 PM] Ali : With the realise of  TesnorFlow 2.0 it's make a lot of sense that Google is investing heavily and this time keeping community centric.

Also earlier the Usergroup's were not supported by Google now they have starred supporting them.

It has a list of features and realises planned. You can follow the GitHub for latest updates or be the part of TesnroFlow Google Group(open for all) to see the latest developments.
- [22/10/19, 8:20:21 PM] Anoop Royal: Thank you. 😇

- [22/10/19, 8:20:47 PM] Anubhav: Hi, I was wondering if you could shed some light on how do you go about introducing Tensorflow to people who have programming knowledge but have little to no prior information on Machine Learning? Do you have a hackathon based approach, where the focus is on learning by doing/completing projects? Or is it more on the theoretical knowledge at first? 

I am assuming the aforementioned participants here do have some form of mathematical knowledge in regards to basic statistics and the ilk.
- [22/10/19, 8:20:56 PM] Eshita Nandy: Hello
What are the future aspects of tensor flow in today's market?
- [22/10/19, 8:21:53 PM] Ali : There are pretty good materials online. 

I highly recommend a series of 6 Codelabs available on Google Codelabs I'll share the URL here itself in sometime.

Also documentation of TF 2.0 is very easy to understand and one can start from it.

After Tensorflow.world more new resources would be available
- [22/10/19, 8:23:21 PM] Ali : For production basis most of the companies Prefer Tensorflow and for research basis most of them use Pytourch.

If you are looking as a Developer it's worth taking the effort to master it.
- [22/10/19, 8:26:02 PM] ‪NUMBER‬: Do you see tensorflow becoming an Industry standard soon? What steps are being taken to encourage widespread adoption of tensorflow?
- [22/10/19, 8:26:34 PM] Ali : LAB 1: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-lab1-helloworld/#0
LAB 2: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-lab2-computervision/
LAB 3: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-lab3-convolutions/
LAB 4: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-lab4-cnns/
LAB 5: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-lab5-compleximages/
LAB 6: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-lab6-largecnns/
- [22/10/19, 8:30:44 PM] Ali : Yes,

If you see the current scenario it's more driving to Community first and it's quite visible with TF 2.0 realise

They have invested heavily in Tensorflow low-level API for research as well that allows you to build onto internals of TesnroFlow without having to rebuild it
- [22/10/19, 8:31:31 PM] Ali : The first step is Tensorflow.world

As you can will see it's a major conference happening just around TF
- [22/10/19, 8:31:49 PM] Ali : Also you might have seen TF Roadshows happening around the Globe
- [22/10/19, 8:33:06 PM] Ali : JavaScript, Swift for Tensorflow is also a NUMBER
- [22/10/19, 8:36:02 PM] ‪NUMBER‬: Hi ali,

Do you have any plans for guwahati to conduct tensorflow. If you are conducting kindly let us know
- [22/10/19, 8:36:43 PM] ‪NUMBER‬: We had one just few days back
- [22/10/19, 8:36:58 PM] Ali : Recently there was a event TesnroFlow All Around happened in Guwahati.
Join us (t.me/TesnroFlowindia)
- [22/10/19, 8:37:30 PM] Ali : *url
t.me/tensorflowindia
- [22/10/19, 8:39:09 PM] Ali : I plan to visit all chapters in-person 🙌 by mid 2020

We have 13 active chapters across the County

- [22/10/19, 8:42:06 PM] ‪NUMBER‬: Thanks for sharing telegram. It nice platform to have around tensorflow.
- [22/10/19, 8:42:57 PM] Ali : Thanks for joining!

I share a link Everyday where you can learn something everyday!
- [22/10/19, 8:43:05 PM] ‪NUMBER‬: Cool
- [22/10/19, 8:43:08 PM] Mriyam da: Hey Ali, thanks for having the AMA.

I would also love to hear your take on this question.
- [22/10/19, 8:44:06 PM] Ali : Oops I missed this one
- [22/10/19, 8:47:26 PM] Ali : I have Trained a lot of students and being a student I feel we get bored out in Theory's.

The approach I follow is very practical approach with a little Important Theory parts. (Very essential for interviews)

By making things they to do mistakes and then when you figure a way to solve the error you learn a lot.

End-To-End projects are very Important.
- [22/10/19, 8:48:07 PM] Ali : I have tried the Hackathon based approach if you keep the audience small works like charm
- [22/10/19, 8:48:36 PM] Saurav Twittee: Hi Ali! Welcome to Hacktoberfest GHY 

1. Can you please share few resources of TF Lite for flutter?

2. What do you think like why one should use the tf over pytorch?

3. What are your pro tips for the developers who want to become a speaker?

 Also, you may share with us any awesome TF project you have worked on!!
- [22/10/19, 8:49:31 PM] Ali : Maths always comes later.

Is it important ? Yes very much.

But messing with it earlier makes people go away from ML itself
- [22/10/19, 8:56:07 PM] Ali : 1. I haven't worked on flutter at large but for Tensorflow for lite there are good resource's available online one of my favourite is Tensorflow for poet's lab.

2. I don't give priority to TF over Pytourch or vice-versa both have many advantages and disadvantages. Pytourch is good for research based work but when I say taking your app to Market TesnroFlow is the king there.

3. Better speaker's means better practise. I am good now just because I have done so many talks. Dev's are mostly nerds and Talks needs Engagement so practice with small audience then gradually increase it.

Yeah I have awesome projects on TF but I haven't put them up in GitHub I show them live 

(As I am still writing Papers for them)
- [22/10/19, 8:56:42 PM] Ali : *Tensorflow
- [22/10/19, 9:00:05 PM] Saurav Twittee: Awesome! Thanks for answering 😃
- [22/10/19, 9:01:23 PM] Anubhav: AH! Thank you so much! 😀 This helps me a lot. I do have a followup question, do you aim to complete a basic project with every session like this? Since you stated that you place higher priority on End-to-End projects? Is this to show the entire process of the development cycle to beginners? And if so, how do you keep it from overwhelming the participants?
- [22/10/19, 9:02:18 PM] Ali : TensorFlow for Software Developers

- [22/10/19, 9:02:49 PM] Saurav Twittee: This one is awesome!
- [22/10/19, 9:02:51 PM] Anubhav: Also, atrocious punctuation here. Sorry for that. I don't know why I put in question marks after everything.
- [22/10/19, 9:06:35 PM] Ali : Yes they should know with what they are getting theirs dirty! 

As they would be suprised in the near future to see the whole process and then blame the trainer as he/she showed a half picture(usually 20-30% is covered in such training and majorly focused on training/building the model).

Yeah there can be an exception when you have an audience for a specific topics or usecase
- [22/10/19, 9:07:18 PM] Ali : Yes it's is 🙌😇
- [22/10/19, 9:07:46 PM] Ali : Pardon me for my auto correct/ spelling mistakes
- [22/10/19, 9:07:55 PM] Anubhav: Amazing! Thank you so much! I have no further questions. 😀
- [22/10/19, 9:08:09 PM] Ali : You're welcome 😇

- [22/10/19, 9:16:19 PM] Joinal WA: Share some light on what is it and if it helps in solving the data problem
- [22/10/19, 9:17:20 PM] Ali : Community is growing and now we also have support coming in from the Google Team.

We will be conducting events/Hackathon and many more activities for beginners!
- [22/10/19, 9:19:06 PM] ‎‪NUMBER‬ left
- [22/10/19, 9:19:37 PM] Ali : Always encourage them.

Don't just redirect everyone to Andrew's course! Understand what they want to do then suggest them resource's.

Make sure you find the right one and if you can't find a GDE for ML who could help.
- [22/10/19, 9:20:12 PM] Ali : If you can't find, A GDE (Google Developer Expert)
- [22/10/19, 9:21:04 PM] Joinal WA: That i personally never do
- [22/10/19, 9:22:03 PM] Joinal WA: Agreed,  we had Dipanjan,  a GDE for ML at the Tf all around event
- [22/10/19, 9:22:30 PM] Joinal WA: We're also working on to get more GDEs getting introduced to the community here
- [22/10/19, 9:23:01 PM] Ali : Not you :p
But I have seen it as a trend.
I find people doing it all the time😅
- [22/10/19, 9:23:45 PM] Joinal WA: True
- [22/10/19, 9:24:22 PM] Ali : Amazing!

Btw community!
@NUMBER is Also one of the Organizer's and is shaping the community in his region 🙌😇

Kudos to you!
- [22/10/19, 9:24:54 PM] Ali : Yes!
- [22/10/19, 9:25:17 PM] Joinal WA: Not me alone ,we have @NUMBER @NUMBER @NUMBER
- [22/10/19, 9:26:11 PM] Joinal WA: Without these guys, i can't imagine managing it remotely
- [22/10/19, 9:26:30 PM] Hrishikesh: thanks @NUMBER for getting this ama up with @NUMBER today. ✨ super insightful answers coming from experiences 😁😁
- [22/10/19, 9:27:59 PM] Joinal WA: I've seen people tangled with mathematics on starters, and leave the main course 🍕
- [22/10/19, 9:28:28 PM] Ali : Yeah! 

With my network in India we were able to lay base for Crowdsource community in India.

Have you used Google Assistant in native language? How much improved it is as compared to a year back?

We have crowdsourced the data for them.

Also the project InclusiveImages where my better half MD. Nawaz presented paper at NIPS(now Neural IPS) on how we collected ~5 million labelled images within 30 days
- [22/10/19, 9:29:00 PM] Joinal WA: Awesome
- [22/10/19, 9:30:09 PM] Hrishikesh: when you talk about community cowdsourcing is it related to fundraising?
- [22/10/19, 9:30:21 PM] Ali : I am no longer part of the Google Crowdsource Team but countinue to do Crowdsource 

I'll be speaking at TesnorFlow.world on how We remove Bias in Machine Learning using Crowdsource in Santa Clara on Oct 29th
- [22/10/19, 9:30:34 PM] Joinal WA: In one of the recent conversations with Manish Manish Gupta,  director of Google Research India, he emphasized on the community,  how it helps on getting the hard work look very easy, it's us the community who shape the big products in longer run
- [22/10/19, 9:31:56 PM] Joinal WA: Also, @NUMBER , I've seen people use latest tech, when something can be done with basic things
- [22/10/19, 9:32:09 PM] Ali : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwZKOmoNxMo

Might help you understand it (feel free to skip first 5 mins after that main talk starts )

- [22/10/19, 9:32:52 PM] Ali : Yes, it's we people always.
- [22/10/19, 9:33:45 PM] Joinal WA: *people
- [22/10/19, 9:35:50 PM] Hrishikesh: 10/10 will look into it
- [22/10/19, 9:37:00 PM] Ali : They were taught that way, still, when I goto institutes I get to hear this a lot (Gan's | Deepfakes | Quantum computing in ML) it's good in research perspective but in the end, they don't even end up writing a paper.

My rec: Teach them how things work well with minimal models, minimal tech! and let them choose their way
- [22/10/19, 9:37:39 PM] Joinal WA: Agreed
- [22/10/19, 9:38:44 PM] Ali : Thanks for having me ! It was a great conversation 😇🙌

Thanks Hrishi for inviting me :)

I'm Srijan and I currently lead recruiting for Clarisights - an enterprise SaaS startup building a next-gen workspace for performance marketing teams. I'm a computer science grad and have been always interested in the product and growth side of things. I started out with contributing to open source projects, spoke at a few conferences which also helped me in building relationships with people around the world. Last year, I interned with Swapcard, Paris as a Growth Engineer! 

Feel free to ask any questions and I'd be happy to help with whatever (little) knowledge I've :D
- 10/26/19, 9:08 PM - Amartya Sk: Hello Srijan , Thank You for your time. I have a question  , like if you are taking in a new team member for a fairly new startup , what are the qualities you would look in her/him?
- 10/26/19, 9:09 PM - NUMBER: Hi! I have a silly question for you. I'm okay with python, but apart from that, which other programming language would you suggest for numerical computation? C, Java?
- 10/26/19, 9:14 PM - Srijan: Hey Amartya,

It totally depends. If by qualities you mean, technical qualities and is applying for an intern/new grad position - I generally look for -
1. Open Source contributions
2. Previous intern experience or relevant projects.
- 10/26/19, 9:17 PM - Srijan: Hey Soumyabrata,

I don't think I'm the right person to answer this question or have the relevant background in numerical computation. I myself have been a polyglot programmer. Given a problem statement, I tend to first understand it and then go for the simplest and fastest way to solve it. It may not be the right/scalable approach but works most of the time.
- 10/26/19, 9:18 PM - NUMBER: Cool
- 10/26/19, 9:18 PM - NUMBER: Hello,

I'm bit confused whether I should first go for learning progamming languages or acquiring knowledge on open source.
Can you give me any suggestion on this?
- 10/26/19, 9:20 PM - Srijan: Hey Bishal,

I'd suggest you to first understand the basics of any programming language. Understanding of a programming language is not just knowing the syntax or how recursion works. If you already know that, great! You are past the first hurdle. Next, you need to take up the task of learning the multiple major libraries and packages that are going to be used in any medium to large scale projects. Look up the relevant libraries of your programming language and devote time to learning them. A good understanding of these will go a long way in helping you understand any code base better.

I also wrote a blogpost on this - https://www.srijanagarwal.me/2016/06/contribute-to-open-source
- 10/26/19, 9:23 PM - NUMBER: Thank you
- 10/26/19, 9:24 PM - NUMBER: Hello srijan, I have been contributing to some open source organisations recently, and the projects that I worked on were basically small or new, which made it easy for me to contribute. My question to you is how should we go about contributing in projects that are already established and have huge number of people already contributing, eg debian, LibreOffice etc?
- 10/26/19, 9:26 PM - Hrishikesh: Hello Srijan, what is your ideal outline suggestion on getting a product (open source or not) from once built to sharing it with people and having more people use it. 

Just posting a side project on ProductHunt helps but does not always get to you a useful feedback to improve your product.

When it comes to marketing a product, all i know is posting it on product hunt, tweeting about it and posting it on reddit. 

This surely gets some eyes on it. What are some other ways to get some eyes?
- 10/26/19, 9:27 PM - Srijan: Hey Anking,

That's absolutely great to hear. Now since you understand the basics, I'd suggest you to start digging deeper orgs which do some hardcore cs work like operating systems, databases, even programming languages. Some of the orgs which come to my mind are Apache, CNCF, Debian, KDE, Ruby, Python, PostgreSQL, MariaDB (if you're into DBs)!
- 10/26/19, 9:27 PM - Srijan: This message was deleted
- 10/26/19, 9:31 PM - NUMBER: Thanks ! I have another question. As a recruiter which student would you give more preference- a student with a GSoC in 1 open-source project or a non-GSoc student with huge contributions in multiple organisations?
- 10/26/19, 9:36 PM - Srijan: Hey Anking,

It totally depends. Usually open source contributions are a metric to evaluate the quality of code. So GSoC doesn't really matter! For eg. I'd still prefer someone who has contributed to core cs organizations! :)
- 10/26/19, 9:36 PM - Hrishikesh: Putting this another way, what is a good way to get feedbacks on ideas and validate if it's something worth working on (in case the developer is expecting it to be used by other people) and not working on the project just as a side project.
- 10/26/19, 9:39 PM - NUMBER: Okay! Thanks for answering 😊
- 10/26/19, 9:39 PM - Kabir: This intrigues me too. Would appreciate to get your opinion
- 10/26/19, 9:43 PM - Srijan: Finding your go-to audience and niche is very important. Your initial users and their feedback define your product. What I'd suggest before working on the idea, is to define the persona of your user and then ask them questions which would help you explain the “why” behind product decisions, find the needs of the users, you can then prioritize features that solve actual user problems and eventually mplement new functionality in line with how users would actually use it.
- 10/26/19, 9:45 PM - NUMBER: Hello Srijan,

Referring to the answer you have given;


Proposal of new algorithm with efficient complexities in this area, will it help?
How can we contribute more to CS org and how to get deep with these courses?
10/26/19, 9:56 PM - Hrishikesh: 📝📝

*note:* Concluding AMA in 10 minutes.
- 10/26/19, 9:57 PM - NUMBER: ?
- 10/26/19, 10:13 PM - Srijan: Hey Anoop, 

Yes that should surely help. Although, the best way to propose that would be by first understanding how the org really works, how the architecture of the software is and that could happen by starting fixing smaller bugs :) 

To go deeper, I’d again suggest to start with something small, and then pick up a bigger task slowly eventually leading you to go deeper. 

I also prefer to read a book to dive deeper on a certain topic on the side too!
- 10/26/19, 10:15 PM - Srijan: If you’ve any more questions, please free to DM me on Twitter(@NUMBERsrijancse) or LinkedIn!
- 10/26/19, 10:15 PM - NUMBER: Thank you 😊
- 10/26/19, 10:23 PM - Hrishikesh: Adding to Srijan's answer, 

I found these two links very useful when trying to have technical overview of different open source projects. [2] is somewhat outdated in the software development years, but still is relevant.

Sayak Paul, he's currently working with PyImageSearch[1] where he works on real world deep learning problems. He was previously a data science instructor at DataCamp[2]. He's also a Google Developers Expert(GDE) and a Intel Software Innovator.

You can ask him questions about his personal experiences in learning/ teaching and what are the difficulties in transitioning from a SDE to a ML engineer etc. Since he's working a lot image search, he'll be the right person to ask any meta image processing question you've been thinking of lately!

He's with us till *8:40PM*
11/2/19, 7:37 PM - NUMBER: Hello Sayak,

How you introduce Data Science to students?
How was your experience at Data Camp?


Being a niche, where to work on?
- 11/2/19, 7:37 PM - NUMBER: Hello everyone. I am Sayak, a Deep Learning Associate at PyImageSearch. My work lies in areas like Computer Vision (domain invariant representations) and general Deep Learning. Pleased to be here :)
- 11/2/19, 7:37 PM - NUMBER: 1.
- 11/2/19, 7:37 PM - Hrishikesh: Correction: *8:10PM*
- 11/2/19, 7:44 PM - NUMBER: Hi Anoop. I will take the second question first as the first question seems to be a bit more open-ended and I would ask you to be a bit more specific. 

As for my experience at DataCamp, it was great.  I got to work with some really great people and the learning experience was just unreal. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. 

> Being a niche, where to work on?

I think it depends a lot on your interests and I always ask people to prioritize that first. Fields like Data Science and Machine Learning are inter-connected and they are really vast in their own course. So, to help yourself for not getting drowned in the vastness, it's important to sort out your interests and plan accordingly. Maybe you are interested in using Deep Learning to solve Computer Vision problems. So, you would definitely want to try working on problems pertaining to that intersection. Once you get a good hold of the fundamentals (I cannot really emphasize this enough) start by picking up problems that are relatively new but still within your range. I typically try to work on problems (pet projects) which require me to study new stuff (at least 25%-30%). This system has so far worked for me quite well :)
- 11/2/19, 7:47 PM - NUMBER: > How you introduce Data Science to students?

I will try answering it briefly, though as I mentioned it's pretty open-ended. First, I try to gauge the expertise level of the students. If they are about to get started then I introduce Data Science by drawing analogies from our real lives - we use data-driven decision making all the time. Isn't it so? before going to a restaurant, we gather data about it and if we good ratings, reviews then only we go there. It's sort of an example that very elegantly establishes the idea of *data-driven decision making*.
- 11/2/19, 7:53 PM - Joinal: Great, @NUMBER , I've seen many people get into ML/AI just because of its hype, how we as a community can address this? Do you have any such observations around it?
- 11/2/19, 7:56 PM - NUMBER: Hi Sayak, one of the problems of our society is dropout rate of students. The data is available in govt website, but how to employ AI/ML to solve it?
- 11/2/19, 7:58 PM - NUMBER: > Great, @NUMBER , I've seen many people get into ML/AI just because of its hype, how we as a community can address this? Do you have any such observations around it?

Oh, absolutely! This is so very true. Sometimes the expectations can get really unrealistic which worries me. 

Being explorers, students, professionals (and everyone else) always try to chase what's new. So that part is really hard to be helped I think. But at the same time, as a community, we can make them more aware of the fact that Machine Learning is not just about calling *model.fit()*, there's a world (several worlds if not less) beyond that. It's important to make them understand that a not-so-detailed approach towards learning the subject only leads to misery. I think Andrej Karpathy's article *A Recipe for Training Neural Networks* (http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/) outlines this very beautifully.
- 11/2/19, 8:00 PM - NUMBER: > Hi Sayak, one of the problems of our society is dropout rate of students. The data is available in govt website, but how to employ AI/ML to solve it?

This is an interesting idea! Unfortunately, I have not yet taken a look at the data you mentioned. But if the features in that data are descriptive enough to justify why a student is dropping out, the relationship good enough to be modeled.
- 11/2/19, 8:00 PM - Hrishikesh: Hello Sayak! This might be somewhat off topic, but I've been eyeing some medical startups which are using image processing to detect skin diseases, eye problems etc. however at the end of the day, people need to go see a doc. to validate the results. Basically, they are not extremely effective.

Is there any way students can work on medical data that'll be having actual impacts. More research = More mistakes = results that actually works 😛

It's almost demotivating sometimes because people in high tech labs with more precise medical equipments are working on these things already. 

This field seems harder to break in compared to something like say "building a ml solution that helps students memorize something better" because the feedback loop is faster and is readily usable once it's working. 

How long till people are able to work on medical data much like any other data out there. 

Or it's already at that point and I am not aware of it.
- 11/2/19, 8:02 PM - Joinal: Agreed, but the lucrative ads saying,  "Become a data scientist in a month, no programming knowledge is required " adds to the problem more
- 11/2/19, 8:03 PM - NUMBER: So true
- 11/2/19, 8:03 PM - NUMBER: I guess we, I mean members of this group, can start working on this project as a community effort!
- 11/2/19, 8:04 PM - NUMBER: I saw a big ad just at the exit of Andheri Station (Major one in Western Mumbai) claiming to teach AI in a month 😅
- 11/2/19, 8:05 PM - NUMBER: I saw few Fb ads claiming become data science expert in 1 month, and placement is guaranteed, and they will take fees only after you get a job with double figures salary.
- 11/2/19, 8:05 PM - Guyaec: @NUMBER  Hey, nice to have you for the AMA, I wanted to ask your experience at PyImageSearch maybe share some problem/experience that you guys regularly deal with.

Also what tips and suggestions would you have for someone aiming at a job in the Machine learning space other than project/strong basics.
- 11/2/19, 8:06 PM - Joinal: NUMBER
- 11/2/19, 8:08 PM - NUMBER: Hi Sir, 

What projects did you get associated in the beginning of data science. Any tips for beginners ??
- 11/2/19, 8:09 PM - NUMBER: Great question. I will try to answer it in parts. 

First of all, you should definitely check out this startup: http://qure.ai/. 

Indeed the field of medical imaging is progressing at a rapid pace with deep learning. I like to think of it as *Machine Learning assisted Human Tasks*. The idea here is to not really replace the doctors but to aid them in their work - accelerate their work at times. 

Regarding working on medical imaging problems, there are a few open-source datasets that are good enough to start with. But this field also requires a lot of sensitivity in terms of privacy. So that's an added challenge. Also, Healthcare data, in general, is not easily available for obvious reasons. But it's good to at least try to approach to local medical institutions and give them some direction so that they could share any data within compliance (this can absolutely be done, I am saying this from my experience).
- 11/2/19, 8:10 PM - NUMBER: Yes. We, as a community, should also highlight the failures that one may incur while pursuing something in this field. And continuously share the struggle :)
- 11/2/19, 8:13 PM - NUMBER: For me, a typical day at PyImageSearch can involve the following:
- *Code stuff*
- Explore a new concept/Read an interesting paper and communicate that to the team
- Put together notebooks to demo something
- Deployment of some of our deep learning projects to embedded devices like Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano and so on
- Review PRs

> Also what tips and suggestions would you have for someone aiming at a job in the Machine learning space other than project/strong basics.

Try to approach things from a software engineer's perspective. Learn to debug a machine learning model and believe me it takes deliberate practice.
- 11/2/19, 8:15 PM - NUMBER: Hi :)

Of course, I had my Titanic, Pima-Indians moments (in fact I still poke around with them when I am trying out something new). But I always tried to remain hands-on. I tried to write my own training loops and compare their performance with something already established. That enabled me to think creatively and be an effective learner.
- 11/2/19, 8:15 PM - Guyaec: thanks , I am a recent graduate so will be moving in for interviews now. Will keep the tip in mind.
- 11/2/19, 8:17 PM - NUMBER: Sure :) You will not find many people (beginners especially) write test cases for their machine learning models whereas it is so very important when you are out there in the wild. Also, try to read other people's code because *A code is more read than it's written* :)

- 11/2/19, 8:19 PM - Joinal: In terms of resources,  mindset etc
- 11/2/19, 8:20 PM - NUMBER: I got hooked to Machine Learning when I had this subject called *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* in my undergrad curriculum. Fortunately or unfortunately my introduction to the field was pretty rigid and math-heavy. So, my curriculum indeed has a lot of influence on what I am today. I would say I partially self-taught.
- 11/2/19, 8:22 PM - Hrishikesh: Thanks for sharing this :) surely will be helpful.
- 11/2/19, 8:22 PM - NUMBER: We are currently working on a TensorFlow SIG that would deal with this very seriously. We will share the news once we have something concrete. 

Regarding the mindset, just allow yourself to be free enough to learn things in an ego-free manner. Don't be embarrassed to be honest - learn like a child and ask questions like a pro :).

Promcon is the annual conference for Prometheus [1]. Entry to the conference is ticket based, means anyone can go attend it you got the cash. 

I am just going to attend it since I got the diversity scholarship, 
There's the *Diversity Scholarship* is a scholarship that many organizations are giving away to increase diversity in tech. 

The selection happens based on previous open source contributions and few other factors. 

So i just wanted to clarify that, the *Selected* word in the title is misleading because anyone can go attend the event if they get the ticket, it's a community event.

That's all. 

Thank you for your wishes :) i hope to learn a lot there and then come back and will share whatever i learn with you ppl. 

We need more ppl to go attend these conferences and get these scholarships and network as well. Our community will grow stronger then. :)

Thanks for reading. I really wanted to get this out.

Suppose i wanted to purchase a tablet.

Bot will take purchase and tablet and show required results. This results should be present in database or if u r using some sort of google search api
