Hello and welcome! 🎉

The goal for this group is to give you the help you need to get started in contributing to open source. 

We'll have a daylong meetup consisting of interesting talks and workshops on a weekend after the 10th of October'19 and another one towards the end of October.

Will share more information on offline events very soon.
- [03/10/19, 12:59:10 PM] Hrishikesh: 🧶(2/4)

Through the lifetime of this group *(Oct 2nd - Nov 2nd)* we’ll work from the small —creating your GitHub account, then understanding what open source is. Then step out and invite some interesting people to do AMAs here in the group, learn some best practices and importance of communication in OSS, share learning resources, etc.

There is no specific time we meet here in the group, you should be able to get help at any time of the day.

Once you complete the challenge, do let us know :)
- [03/10/19, 1:00:04 PM] Hrishikesh: 🧶(3/4)

What kinds of questions you can ask, you ask?

💡If it's a code related help, but try googling first.
💡If it's a question related to git/GitHub any other tool involved.
💡If you're not able to find a repository to contribute to.
💡If you need learning material on something.
💡If it's about the opensource ecosystem.

If you think any other question is appropriate for the group, please do ask.

We'll keep a daily chat log at: http://bit.ly/hof-ghy-chat so that new participants can view previous messages.
- [03/10/19, 1:00:12 PM] ‪+NUMBER‬: 👍🏽
- [03/10/19, 1:00:55 PM] Hrishikesh: 🧶(4/4)

Everyone in the group can help everyone, but we also have members who are maintainers of OSS projects, GSoC mentors and people who have been contributing to OSS for a significant amount of time, so you're well backed. 👨‍👨‍👦‍👦👩‍👩‍👧‍👧

I'd encourage members to introduce themselves.

One more thing,

This isn’t a WhatsApp University :D, it’s a conversation. If you don’t understand something, have any question, please ask.
- [03/10/19, 1:03:48 PM] Hrishikesh: So all the best! 👊👊

- [03/10/19, 4:17:04 PM] Saurav Twittee: also, check out the page! https://hackoctoberfest-ghy.netlify.com/
You must have a GitHub account and then registered for it.
- [03/10/19, 4:23:18 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Thanks. Checking out
- [03/10/19, 4:23:49 PM] Joinal WA: @NUMBER can we do a bot of some kind, auto greet with pointers to relevant links
- [03/10/19, 4:26:45 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: registered in github and hacktober.Now what next?
- [03/10/19, 4:27:23 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/


Can we all contribute to this one?
- [03/10/19, 4:30:52 PM] Hrishikesh: does it have a github repository? for participating, the project you're going to contribute to has to be hosted on GitHub.
- [03/10/19, 4:31:57 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Oh okay, I need to check that.
- [03/10/19, 4:33:16 PM] Hrishikesh: you need to find a repository/project to contribute to.  see the section Hacktoberfest projects at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/

you can filter projects based on languages you know there.
- [03/10/19, 4:34:52 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: We can choose any project on github, right?
- [03/10/19, 4:35:05 PM] Hrishikesh: that's true.
- [03/10/19, 4:35:15 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: 👍🏻
- [03/10/19, 4:48:09 PM] Hrishikesh: think this will be an overkill for now, I've added the intro message from the morning to the *Read this first* link in the group description.
- [03/10/19, 4:48:22 PM] Joinal WA: Okay
- [03/10/19, 4:48:50 PM] Joinal WA: But, can be a great task for contributions
- [03/10/19, 4:52:40 PM] Hrishikesh: haha, damn right. Contributing to your own repositories still count as contributions towards the 4PRs for Hackoctoberfest.

as long as you don't abuse this, 10/10 someone can take this project up. 😁
- [03/10/19, 4:53:09 PM] Joinal WA: Yes
- [03/10/19, 4:53:16 PM] Joinal WA: And we can use this later also
- [03/10/19, 4:53:28 PM] Joinal WA: Or maybe opensource it for future
- [03/10/19, 4:54:19 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Ah, I've my own repo, I can work on that then
- [03/10/19, 4:54:43 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: @NUMBER, remember? Last year you too contributed to that!
- [03/10/19, 4:58:25 PM] Hrishikesh: the only drawback i see to this is that, you will not get feedbacks and you'll just be confined to your own project. 

Contributing to someone else's code, 
1. you'll learn to read other ppl's code
2. you'll have to communicate with them
3. you meet new people.
4. most of the time when you contribute to some well written repository, you end up writing better code.

I think there are many more benifits to contributing to someone else's project.
- [03/10/19, 4:58:38 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: My humble suggestion is to understand how many of the group members know how to use github
- [03/10/19, 4:59:30 PM] Joinal WA: Agreed
- [03/10/19, 4:59:31 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: I barely know!
- [03/10/19, 5:00:46 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: I can rate my github using skills for like 7 from a scale of 0 to 10
- [03/10/19, 5:01:58 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: For those who are new to GitHub, someone needs to help them out
- [03/10/19, 5:02:04 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Mine is barely 1. I can just code & upload!
- [03/10/19, 5:02:55 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: I think this should be the first step if we want our mission to succeed in the long run

- [03/10/19, 5:04:54 PM] Hrishikesh: @NUMBER has a video up on YouTube where he explains Git and GitHub in Assamese. 

I am sure it'll help. 
https://youtu.be/v3SIwwPjUGU

We'll try to add a beginner section to the website as well. soon.
- [03/10/19, 5:05:26 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Sure, thanks for sharing the video
- [03/10/19, 5:06:08 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Can we also plan for some knowledge sharing session on GitHub for the beginners
- [03/10/19, 5:06:22 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Lot of youtube tutorials available for the same
- [03/10/19, 5:06:25 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: I can we can make them use some youtube references to learn everything about Github and Git as a whole
- [03/10/19, 5:06:45 PM] ‎‪NUMBER:‬ joined using this group's invite link
- [03/10/19, 5:07:18 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Videos are there but actual hands on session will be better
- [03/10/19, 5:08:30 PM] Hrishikesh: We're planning for an offline meetup after 10th October. date and venue is not fixed yet. will keep the group updated about it.
- [03/10/19, 5:09:00 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Ok sure, thanks for the initiative

- [03/10/19, 5:10:30 PM] Joinal WA: @NUMBER connect with Girlscript Guwahati lead
- [03/10/19, 5:11:55 PM] Hrishikesh: messaged on LinkedIn, waiting for response.
- [03/10/19, 5:12:09 PM] Joinal WA: Shall i ask Anubha about this?
- [03/10/19, 5:12:20 PM] Amartya Sk: Eshita Nandy ?
- [03/10/19, 5:12:31 PM] Joinal WA: FYI Anubha is Girlscript founder?
- [03/10/19, 5:12:35 PM] Joinal WA: I guess so
- [03/10/19, 5:33:51 PM] Saurav Twittee: That will be awesome
- [03/10/19, 5:36:13 PM] Saurav Twittee: Connect with the local coding clubs,chapters and if there any gdg ah we don't have an active gdg yet from northeast!!
- [03/10/19, 5:47:14 PM] Mriyam da: For the people asking Git and/or GitHub, I've found these videos to be helpful in the past(only for those who don't prefer text, but text is almost always better than video),

Also, the link shared by @NUMBER from Julia's blog - https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/ is a must read for people getting into open source.
If you do read this, I'd also suggest this as additional reading - http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
- [03/10/19, 5:51:10 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Gdg chapter is required
- [03/10/19, 6:06:08 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Thanks
- [03/10/19, 7:06:46 PM] Saurav Twittee: Hi 

You can simply contribute to documentation part for a project too other than coding!


Just keep on looking for a good issue that you are interested to work on,make sure you leave a comment there in that issue that you wanna work on so that the maintainer can assign you for that then simply fork it,make changes as mentioned in the issue and make Pull Request!
- [03/10/19, 7:31:37 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: what else we can work on apart from coding?
- [03/10/19, 8:09:05 PM] Mriyam da: Open source projects require a lot of help apart from coding. 

You can help -

* Write documentation
* Triage issues
and many others.
- [03/10/19, 8:11:15 PM] Mriyam da: But whatever information we're giving is likely less compared to the curated resources explaining every question being asked by beginners which can be found here in the link @NUMBER mentioned. 


https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details


Check the beginners section
- [03/10/19, 8:15:00 PM] Mriyam da: For example, I checked out https://www.firsttimersonly.com/, which I got from the above link.

There is a really cool video mentioned - http://www.getinvolvedintech.com/

Also found a link to a site which displays any GitHub user's first PR, and as an example here is Kent's first PR https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/616

It's just a spelling mistake fix, which is perfect for a first time PR. It shows that one understands Git and knows how to create a pull request on GitHub.
- [03/10/19, 8:30:15 PM] Hrishikesh: the video mentioned by @NUMBER  is from Scott Hanselman's page. Very friendly person to follow on Twitter, he tweets about oss as well.

Tells you the meta information that is required when contributing like, _Look through the existing issues and PRs_ and other helpful tips.
- [05/10/19, 9:43:48 AM] Anubhav: Can we make it into a sticky or pinned message?
- [05/10/19, 10:08:07 AM] Guyaec: it's in description, and the rest remaining links can be put there. but not as sticky banner like telegram WhatsApp doesn't have that I think.
- [05/10/19, 11:42:04 PM] Hrishikesh: Hello, hope everyone is doing good!

By now, most of us already know that a GitHub repository can contain anything and not only code.

So, @NUMBER is preparing a GitHub repository which will be a list of all members from this group with their github handle and other social media links. 🌎

members of this group can make a PR with their name, github handle and social links. 

this will help know each other better as well as will be a good first PR. :)

There will also be supporting instructions on how to go about adding your name and links to the list with a PR.

Thanks to @NUMBER for the idea.
- [05/10/19, 11:44:34 PM] ‪NUMBER:‬: Wow. Awesome 👌

- [08/10/19, 11:43:50 AM] Mriyam da: Looks like a few people did send PRs. 🥳 

Those who're completely new to Git/GitHub you can read the links provided and also watch the demo video given in the repository's README. 🏃‍♀🏃‍♂
- [08/10/19, 11:45:30 AM] Mriyam da: Those who created the PR in this repository or already know the Git/GitHub PR can find an open source repository they like and contribute to it.

Once you create 4 PRs this month, and get them merged, you'll get a cool T-Shirt and some stickers!🔥🎉
- [08/10/19, 11:48:41 AM] Mriyam da: If you don't know which project/repositories you should contribute to, you can find some suggestions on the main site itself - https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/

But this is not an exhaustive list, you can contribute to any project/repositories on GitHub, whether they are marked for Hacktoberfest or not.
- [08/10/19, 11:52:53 AM] Mriyam da: If anyone *has gone through the already shared resources* and are still facing problems, you can message me directly with your question. Happy to help.

- [08/10/19, 2:26:57 PM] Joinal WA: @NUMBER @NUMBER @NUMBER as per HacktoberFest guidelines, only high quality contributions qualify for a PR to recieve goodies from DO
- [08/10/19, 2:27:05 PM] Joinal WA: Please comply
- [08/10/19, 2:28:45 PM] Joinal WA: And discourage folks to apply for goodies with only basic PRs
- [08/10/19, 2:30:22 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: What does basic PRs mean?
- [08/10/19, 2:31:15 PM] Mriyam da: Just chiming in, from the Hacktoberfest site

_To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and then make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as invalid or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt. (Last year 46,088 earned a shirt!)_
- [08/10/19, 2:31:47 PM] Joinal WA: Consider the PR you'd be submitting in the Repo LearnPR, this just helps you learn git basics and doesn't has any significant code contributions
- [08/10/19, 2:33:16 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: Thanks for the reply
- [08/10/19, 2:34:18 PM] Joinal WA: Hi there,
Thanks for your interest in Hacktoberfest and helping others learn how to make their first contributions to open source!
That said, high-quality contributions are part of the the core values of Hacktoberfest, so we kindly ask that you do not create repositories which allow users to quickly gain a PR toward completing the challenge.
We encourage you to take a look at our list of Hacktoberfest issues for inspiration and ideas about making meaningful contributions to open source projects.
Due to this, we've added this repository to our list of excluded repositories and pull requests here will not count toward Hacktoberfest 2019.
Please note, you are welcome to keep running this repository as a learning tool for new contributors to open-source, but pull requests won’t count toward Hacktoberfest.
Happy Hacking,
The Hacktoberfest Team
Hacktoberfest is presented by DigitalOcean and DEV.
- [08/10/19, 2:35:04 PM] Joinal WA: From the team that handles HacktoberFest at DO
- [08/10/19, 2:35:15 PM] Joinal WA: Not an issue
- [08/10/19, 2:45:43 PM] Mriyam da: Agree with this. LearnPR repo should not be part of the PRs one considers as their contribution to Hacktoberfest.
- [08/10/19, 2:45:58 PM] Joinal WA: Exactly
- [08/10/19, 2:46:37 PM] Joinal WA: https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#quality-standards
- [08/10/19, 2:47:58 PM] Joinal WA: I'll release a few "good for first contributions" into one of my projects tomorrow
- [08/10/19, 2:48:05 PM] Hrishikesh: part of this message talking about contributions going towards hacktoberfest is cancelled then.

anyway still is a good way to get started.
- [08/10/19, 2:48:42 PM] Joinal WA: Not saying it's noy a good way to get started
- [08/10/19, 2:49:13 PM] Joinal WA: But, shouldn't be considered as a PR to be counted as one of 5
- [08/10/19, 2:50:02 PM] Joinal WA: We as org admins, project mantainers will ensure to release atleast 5 issues for the participants to work on and contribute

I've been searching for hours, watched quite a few videos, but can't understand what exactly this is! Coming from Mechanichal Engineering background, my idea of Entropy is that from Thermal background!

- [12/10/19, 3:41:45 PM] Hrishikesh: *Reminder*

We'll be having an ama with Ashris at 9PM today.
- [12/10/19, 4:36:26 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: 🤘
- [12/10/19, 9:08:24 PM] ‎You added Ashrish Choudhary
- [12/10/19, 9:09:06 PM] Hrishikesh: Hello everyone,

We have the first AMA in the month of October today. 🥳

Thanks Ashrish for joining us here! I've already introduced him but I'd still like to ask Asrish to introduce himself briefly to the group whenever he's ready.

**Note:**
He'll be doing this ama till 10PM, so ask away your questions and he'll try his best to answer them. :)
- [12/10/19, 9:09:54 PM] Hrishikesh: *Ashris : typo
- ‎[12/10/19, 9:10:56 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: ‎video omitted
- [12/10/19, 9:10:57 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: ^ Hey guys! Looking forward to your questions! Thanks Hrishikesh for organizing this.
- [12/10/19, 9:12:44 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: Hii Ashris Bhaiya thanks for AMA
- [12/10/19, 9:13:07 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: my question is that How do you choose project? How you select the difficulty of the project?
- [12/10/19, 9:15:54 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: So I have done the Hacktoberfest twice. The best way I think is to look for the Hacktoberfest tag on Github - lot of people tag beginner friendly bugs for you to solve, that could be a good start. You can even work with some college seniors on their projects - usually someone who has worked in Hacktoberfest before is a good idea. Look for something that is in your comfort zone, is beginner friendly and can be done using 10-15 lines of code. Discussing with the repo owner about the complexity of the bug you are trying to fix can be a good start. Wish you all the best!
- [12/10/19, 9:16:42 PM] Amartya Sk: Hello  Ashris, Thank You for your time. Media Labs must be awesome experience.

I'd like to ask , what are your views on startup teams , Suppose you have a startup and, you're taking in more members ,  like  what qualities do you look in a person who'd want to join your team.
- [12/10/19, 9:16:43 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: ok thanks🙂
- [12/10/19, 9:16:53 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq#general <- is a good starting point.
- [12/10/19, 9:17:40 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: Hi! How to get into PhD in MIT. I'm 34 years old and been in academics all my life, no industrial experience
- [12/10/19, 9:21:11 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: This is such a relevant and a great question. When investors look to find ideas, they look at the team also. Not only should your idea be impactful but you should prove why you are the right people to solve it. At MIT, in one of the entrepreneurship classes, I was told that every good startup needs a combination of 3 kinds of people - the hustler, the hacker and the hipster. Hustlers are the ones who know business, can do sales and marketing. Hackers are your tech wizs and Hipsters are the Design/product wizs who know why to build something. When I try to team with someone, I see which domain do they belong to and how much of self driven projects have they done - because that shows that they are genuinely interested and skilled in what they do.
- [12/10/19, 9:24:40 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: So I might not be the best person to answer this because I think of myself more of the startup guy than an academic guy, but I think the key to a good PhD is the right mentor who aligns with your goals and is willing to support you. Writing to professors about your interests and experience would be great. Attending conferences in US where you can network with Professors directly is a good option. MIT also has some great tie ups with Indian companies like TATA where they can sponsor PhD students working on topics crucial for developing nations. Reaching out to these institutions would be great.
- [12/10/19, 9:24:57 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: What would you suggest -mastering one particular domain or jack of all trade?
- [12/10/19, 9:25:46 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: The last line was valuable for me. I didn't know that. Thanks 😊
- [12/10/19, 9:26:03 PM] Amartya Sk: Awesome , got it , Hustler - Hacker - Hipster. 

Also , I'd like to know , what is the stage/state of a startup when it starts getting funded ? Like , (1) the idea state (we can do this that wala state), (2) some tid bid research done wala state , (3) prototype ready wala state (4) some revenue generated wala state.
- [12/10/19, 9:27:03 PM] Hrishikesh: When you were a student, how did you takeout time to start and finish a side projects? It's easy to start something but finishing it is the hard part for me. Or putting this another way, at what point do you think we should stop working on a side project because it's taking too much time. I've only managed to finish only a few but it's just demotivating when I look at the number of dead projects that I have :p
- [12/10/19, 9:28:05 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: plz answer this. I have the same problem
- [12/10/19, 9:28:10 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: ..
- [12/10/19, 9:28:39 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Definitely master one domain in the long run. Find one domain where you are in the top 5% of the world. Now, the interesting thing is 'domain' is not defined well. I believe we are living in a world where domains are merging to become new domains. Like psychology, neurology and AI combine to form cognitive augmentation. The established domains like physics, maths are all saturated, it is extremely hard to shine there. So for the initial years, like now, try to be a jack of all trades - do many things until you find the right mixture, make it a domain and be great at it. For example, I was good in design and code. Was I an awesome coder? Maybe not. Was I an awesome designer? Maybe not. But when I combined them two and did data viz, I unlocked a field not many are doing and it was easy for me to do things. I recommend this route.
- [12/10/19, 9:28:56 PM] Amartya Sk: Also , another question , like what would you prefer , the attitude of a startup leader should be - (1) day /night we have to do this anyhow , some team members have some errand to do ,go later  complete now  wala attitude , or (2) or go , do your errand and we can complete this later wala attitude. ?
- [12/10/19, 9:31:39 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Make a goal towards which you are working. For me, the goal was getting in to MIT Media Lab, I would think about it while sleeping, while dreaming, while walking. It motivated me to do things. I knew that no matter how many ideas I have, it is only the finished ones that will go to my portfolio. At one time, I was just filling the grid boxes with thumbnails of my incomplete projects that would motivate me to finish them. Once I finished one after a lot of hard work, I was addicted to keep going. So build that momentum, align yourself to some external goal towards which you are working. In my initial years, it was just about impressing my friends with my ideas - find an external drive.
- [12/10/19, 9:32:14 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: ok I get it . I was a bit of confusion to how should I invest my time . it's clear now.
- [12/10/19, 9:33:46 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Definitely 4 - someone will pour money on you when you already have set the fire and their money would just help it blaze more and earn more money 💰💰💰. You have to solve a problem of society that society doesn't yet know how to fix. There is no short cut. No prototype or website is going to fake it. You need to find someone willing to pay for your product, only then can you even think of an investor.
- [12/10/19, 9:38:03 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Interesting. As a startup founder, you are someone who is creating a new thing in the world. You are like a mother to a baby. Can a mother leave the baby and just chill? No, the baby is too fragile and it will die of negligence. A startup is like that, you have to nurture it continuously. When you have employees, you cannot babysit them, they need to feel part of the product also to give their 200%. So if you are serious about a startup, it should be everything of your life - something you think when you sleep and when you wake up - this is why startups are not for everyone. It is bleed for 5 years so that you dont have to bleed ever again wala mentality.
- [12/10/19, 9:38:56 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: How to get into MIT media lab like you?
- [12/10/19, 9:40:57 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: Adding to your answer I would like to ask that how to choose which particular field I should master in by keeping in mind about the scenario of the future market?
- [12/10/19, 9:40:57 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Work on crazy projects, have a stellar portfolio, reach out to professors personally and learn new things every day - even if it doesn't guarantee Media Lab, you will easily be ahead of 99% of people your age.
- [12/10/19, 9:41:37 PM] Hrishikesh: haha awesome! thanks a lot! I've started following a very similar approach. I am not sure if it can be called an external drive but I've made a small list of practical ideas to work on, i keep thinking and brainstorming on them a lot and during my final days at college just prepping myself so that i can work on them later on.
- [12/10/19, 9:42:27 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: yahh. trying hard matters.
- [12/10/19, 9:43:03 PM] Amartya Sk: 💯 onpoint.
- [12/10/19, 9:44:58 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Three things - what you love doing, what pays you well and what you are good at. You may love aerospace and it even pays well but if you arent good at it, there is no point. Try to find things that hit all these boxes. Now, what pays you well is a subjective thing, there is no way of being sure but the world is going in a direction, there are some things like AI, creativity, data, service based industries, Electric vehicles and blockchains which are booming - see what connects with you in these emerging fields. Don't stress out too much, as a thumb rule if you can code, you are guaranteed on the pay well aspect - the other two checkboxes are for you to infer.
- [12/10/19, 9:45:17 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Sounds awesome! Pretty similar to what I had done too.
- [12/10/19, 9:46:18 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: Should the projects be something that no one ever tried which is very new.?
- [12/10/19, 9:47:23 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: Thanks✨
- [12/10/19, 9:47:34 PM] Amartya Sk: What does it take to make it to an Ivy league Masters or Maybe CSAIL Masters  , like is it Research Work done  of similar kind to the projects ongoing at CSAIL , or is it something different (like entire portfolio) , how far GRE marks/ institute name holds strong to admission process.
- [12/10/19, 9:48:45 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Yes and no - Media Lab values interdisciplinary approach to building things. You can take two normal but unrelated skills and fuse them together to make something new. You don't have to reinvent the wheel, just find new ways existing things can be paired. Be really good at one thing - electronics, code or fabrication and show how you can use them like artists use colors, poets use poetry to create magic.
- [12/10/19, 9:50:03 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Depends on the uni but yes, your institute, your GPA, your GRE, Letters of recommendation from machau people, SOP and yes, connections - all of these things. Having stellar internships also helps.
- [12/10/19, 9:53:20 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: How much time we should devote to do projects or  learning in one field may be it is data science or block chain? When to move to other field?
- [12/10/19, 9:54:14 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Personally, I think Masters have become very devalued. We live in a world where knowledge is freely flowing. There is no 'knowledge' that is specially stored in these degrees - it is the connections and the stamp of a good university people go to these colleges for. I didn't think the ego boost is worth so much money. But if you have dispensible money and you want to do Masters for exploring new culture, pursue something very special, are evry sure that you want to work in a certain country or you know that the alumnus network is strong for you to go where you want in life, then go ahead. But doing masters from a fancy place just because society thinks its cool is a very very bad and an expensive idea.
- [12/10/19, 9:56:52 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: You cannot learn or even master a field while you are in college. People have been working on these for decades, you surely cant master these in a year. So I'd advise the best investment of your time in college should be to learn how to learn. Realize you will never master a thing fully but you can learn the basics so well that it helps you even when you are doing something unrelated. It is not the same as jack of all trades - it is knowing the basics of many fields very strongly so that you can use them if you have to.
- [12/10/19, 9:57:55 PM] Arunav GIMT: If you are doing your project in data science is it necessary to publish paper in reputed publications???
- [12/10/19, 9:58:52 PM] Hrishikesh: When looking at it generally, how much of a difference do you think college(high ed) makes in a Student's life?

Do you think graduating from a not so good college(or should I say where the education is bad) pre 2015 vs graduating from that same college today in 2019 is different because we have so much of great learning materials on the Internet today that college should not matter at all?
- [12/10/19, 9:59:05 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: ok . After all its important to master the basics of all.
- [12/10/19, 10:00:49 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Ugh, I personally haven't read more than 10 papers in my life. I find them very boring. It isn't the medium that is important but your work. I honestly just write Medium articles, it has helped my work reach to more people. I find the academic paper wala language to be very terse and unnescessarily complex. It is one of the reasons I did not pursue academia ahead. If you are sure that academia is your thing, then yes, writing papers and getting them published is very important, but if you are doing a startup or are applying for jobs, its not important enough. Reading papers will definitely help you sharpen your mind, but not necessarily writing for publications.
- [12/10/19, 10:00:53 PM] Hrishikesh: *Note:* AMA ends in ~5 mins

Sourav here 

What are your views on opensource in AI?
Can you give some inputs and trends about it! 

Also if you share any cool project you have worked on and YouTube channel link!!
- [12/10/19, 10:03:07 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: I love this question. Yes, the world has changed sooooo much! It matters so little where you studied if you are in the startup world, maybe except for impressing few snobby VCs. YouTube, Coursera, all of those have shattered the walls academia had created. There is no reason to cite your college as an excuse. If you are smart, ambitious and hard working,(and are blessed to be born in a stable family in a stable country - which I hope you all are) this is the best time to be alive.
- [12/10/19, 10:03:08 PM] Arunav GIMT: thanks a lot

- [12/10/19, 10:05:47 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: Thanks for all the help
- [12/10/19, 10:07:09 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Hey Sourav! Open Source is responsible for probably 80% of the innovation happening today in the world. OpenAI, the initiative by Elon Musk is sharing so much of quality resources. Side note, all of you should be on Twitter and follow these guys - ElonMusk, Open AI, Andrej Karpathy, etc etc - you will get so much of cutting edge research work right in your feed. You can have a look at my projects at https://iashris.com - I think the Facebook network visualization (it has a video on YouTube) is probably the coolest one, followed by https://13x29.github.io
- [12/10/19, 10:07:57 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Yo guys! I had so much fun doing this, feel free to reach out to me at hello@iashris.com
- [12/10/19, 10:08:10 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: I'd be happy to answer few more questions if you still have them

it's been so great having you here today!
- [12/10/19, 10:09:23 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Likewise, I think all of the folks in this group are incredibly fortunate to have their mentor take initiatives like this. Keep learning, keep exploring and keep evolving, yo!
- [12/10/19, 10:09:46 PM] ‪\+NUMBER:‬: How to get into top IT companies ?  some people say competitive programming help a lot, some says having interesting project helps. What would you say??
- [12/10/19, 10:13:13 PM] Hrishikesh: *Note*: we'll publish a blogpost in a day or two with the questions and answers from this AMA so that people who missed it can read it later. is that fine by you @NUMBER?
- [12/10/19, 10:13:42 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Well, each company has its own way of picking people. Once you are being interviewed, it is your acumen that matters there. The tough part is to get an interview after being shortlisted through the series of automated tests. Some hacks help like having the keywords in your resume that companies are looking for. But nothing beats just being plain good in your skills. Some sure shot things that work is to be more visible - go present your work in conferences, take up GSoC, participate in the Facebook bug bountry programs, start helping startups in their open source projects - if you do all this, may be not the top4 [facebook, google, apple, amazon] come to you, but many IT companies will line up for you to join them.
- [12/10/19, 10:14:01 PM] Ashrish Choudhary: Of course! Do go ahead.
